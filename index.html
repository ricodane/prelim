      <p>Leads the Agile approach to software development</p>
    </div>
    <p class="btmspace-50 justified">The Agile Manifesto and the Twelve Principles of Agile Software were the consequences of industry frustration in the 1990s. The enormous time lag between business requirements (the applications and features customers were requesting) and the delivery of technology that answered those needs, led to the cancelling of many projects. Business, requirements, and customer requisites changed during this lag time, and the final product did not meet the then current needs. The software development models of the day, led by the Waterfall model, were not meeting the demand for speed and did not take advantage of just how quickly software could be altered.</p>

          <h6 class="heading">Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools</h6>
          <p>Valuing people more highly than processes or tools is easy to understand because it is the people who respond to business needs and drive the development process</p>

          <p>Negotiation is the period when the customer and the product manager work out the details of a delivery, with points along the way where the details may be renegotiated</p>

      <li class="one_quarter">
        
          <h6 class="heading">Responding to Change Over Following a Plan</h6>
          <p>The intention was to develop detailed, elaborate plans, with a defined set of features and with everything, generally, having as high a priority as everything else, and with a large number of many dependencies on delivering in a certain order so that the team can work on the next piece of the puzzle</p>
